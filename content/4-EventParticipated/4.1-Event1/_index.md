# Event Takeaways: "AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1 - AI/ML/GenAI on AWS"

### Program Focus

- Explore the full landscape of AI/ML/GenAI capabilities on AWS and methodologies for applying them to real-world scenarios.

### Speakers

- **Lam Tuan Kiet** – Sr DevOps Engineer, FPT Software  
- **Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi** – AI Engineer, Renova Cloud  
- **Dinh Le Hoang Anh** – Cloud Engineer Trainee, First Cloud AI Journey  
- **Van Hoang Kha** – Community Builder

### Key Highlights

## 1. Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock Platform

**Foundation Models (FMs):**  
AWS offers a curated collection of fully managed foundation models from top AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta, etc.), enabling customization for diverse tasks without training models from scratch.

**Prompt Engineering Techniques:**  
Mastering how to steer models effectively through various prompting strategies:
  + **Zero-shot:** Model receives only the task description, no examples.  
  + **Few-shot:** Model is provided several examples to learn from.  
  + **Chain-of-Thought:** Encouraging the model to demonstrate reasoning steps for enhanced accuracy.

**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):**  
Boosts output quality by injecting external knowledge:
  + **R – Retrieval:** Extracts relevant data from a knowledge repository.  
  + **A – Augmentation:** Incorporates this data as context within the prompt.  
  + **G – Generation:** Model produces more grounded and precise responses.  
  + **Applications:** Context-aware chatbots, advanced search capabilities, and real-time data summarization.

**Amazon Titan Embeddings:**  
Compact embedding model transforming text into dense vectors for similarity search and RAG workflows, featuring multilingual support.

**AWS AI Services:** Ready-to-use AI APIs:
  - Rekognition – Image/Video analysis  
  - Translate – Language translation  
  - Textract – Document text & layout extraction  
  - Transcribe – Speech-to-text conversion  
  - Polly – Text-to-speech synthesis  
  - Comprehend – Natural language processing  
  - Kendra – Enterprise intelligent search  
  - Lookout – Anomaly detection  
  - Personalize – Recommendation engines  

**Demo Highlight:**  
A facial recognition application (AMZPhoto) illustrating AI services integration into user-facing products.

## 2. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore – Framework for Production-Ready AI Agents

A novel framework empowering teams to operate AI agents reliably at scale:
  - Execute and scale agent workflows securely  
  - Handle long-term memory management  
  - Provide fine-grained identity & access control  
  - Integrate with tools including Browser Tool, Code Interpreter, Memory Store  
  - Deliver observability and auditing capabilities  
  - Support popular agent frameworks (CrewAI, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, OpenAI Agents SDK, etc.)

---

### Core Insights

- **Bedrock as the central GenAI platform:** Streamlined access to multiple FMs in a unified location.  
- **Prompting + RAG as customization mechanisms:** Enhance model relevance through context and examples.  
- **Embeddings for intelligent search:** Titan Embeddings elevates retrieval accuracy for knowledge-driven applications.  
- **Pre-built models accelerate development timelines:** Eliminates the need to construct everything manually.  
- **AgentCore minimizes deployment complexity:** Manages scaling, memory, identity, and monitoring for agentic systems.

---

### Practical Applications

- Session concepts (particularly RAG and AgentCore) can be directly aligned with upcoming internal projects involving GenAI-powered features.
- Comprehensive understanding of AWS AI services facilitates selecting appropriate tools for varying application requirements, accelerating development cycles.
- Acquired knowledge about prompt engineering can be leveraged to enhance AI model performance across multiple scenarios.

### Event Experience

Participating in the **"GenAI-powered App-DB Modernization"** workshop delivered an exceptionally valuable experience, offering comprehensive insights into modernization approaches for applications and databases using contemporary tools and methodologies. Memorable highlights included:

- Secured top 5 placement in the end-of-event Kahoot Quiz and photographed with speakers.
- Established a small collaborative team named **"Mèo Cam Đeo Khăn"** (Orange Cat with Scarf), combining members from "The Ballers" and "Vinhomies".
