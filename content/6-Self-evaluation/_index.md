During my internship at **AWS** from **08/09/2025** to **12/11/2025**, I had a valuable opportunity to learn, practice, and extensively apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world, professional, and challenging working environment.

I participated in the **MeetAssist Project - Automated Scheduling Chatbot**, a key project aimed at optimizing customer interaction and scheduling processes. Through this, I comprehensively developed many important skill groups, thereby improving my **Programming, Knowledge and Usage of AWS Services, Requirements Analysis and System Design, Teamwork and Communication, Technical Report Writing and Documentation...**.

In terms of work ethic, I always maintained a high sense of responsibility, strived to complete assigned tasks well, ensured strict compliance with regulations and the team's product development processes, and actively engaged in discussions and learning from colleagues and mentors to continuously improve work efficiency and quality.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
